# As of latest preview, Bedrock has added this functionality into the game. Deprecsting this lol.

# Get Block

Basically works like the middle mouse button, except us mobile users don't have a mouse to get the block.

> [!NOTE] > **In order for this addon to work, you need to go into `Experimental Gameplay` and enable `Beta APIs`**
> You need to be operator to run these commands.

## Installation

Click [here](https://github.com/ypacks/get-block/releases/latest) for the latest version.\
Scroll down till you find the bold blue .mcaddon file, click it to download it then use whatever you use to import the mod. (If you don't have one, FX file Explorer or ZArchiver, or some other method.)

## Commands

### $bind

Run this command (while having an item selected in your hotbar, preferrably something like a sword that can't break blocks) to make an item give you the block you break.
This will replace the item with the block you want.

> [!NOTE] > Only 1 item can have a binding. You don't need more than one.

### $unbind

Unbind the item, will not return anything.
